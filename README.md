"The rise of philosophy itself can be interpreted, I think, as a response to
the breakdown of the closed society and its magical beliefs. It is an attempt
to replace the lost magical faith by a rational faith; it modifies the tradition
of passing on a theory or a myth by founding a new traditionâ€”the tradition
of challenging theories and myths and of critically discussing them" (Karl Popper)
